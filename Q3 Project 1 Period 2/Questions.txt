Write as many questions as you can based on the project specs.

When is the project due?
What is a "maze level"?
Can we use a built-in stack or queue instead of making our own?
Can we use existing pathfinding algorithms?
Do we need to handle every possible scenario to get full credit?
Can we use data structures other than stacks and queues?
Is there a runtime limit for full credit, and if so, what is it?
Can we still get full credit if our solution is slow but correct?
Can we score above 100% by completing the extra credit?
Do we write our own tests or are they provided?
How many commits and pushes are needed for full credit?
If we finish early, do we still need to keep committing to get full credit?
Where should we start when writing the design plan?
Is a brute force approach that tries every path allowed?
Do we need to add comments explaining what our code does?
